# Activity & POI web component

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-activity-poi)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-activity-poi)
[![CI](https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-activity-poi/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-activity-poi/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a web component that can be integrated in other software (for example
websites) to show the activities and point of interests of South Tyrol. They are
shown on a map and they can be filtered based on the category or a search term.
Each point of interest/activity has a corresponding marker on the map and its
details are displayed when it is clicked on it.

Do you want to see it in action? Go to our [web component store](https://webcomponents.opendatahub.bz.it/webcomponent/0e5fbede-4a21-4dd3-bf85-7d2be71dfb12)!

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- ToDo: Check the prerequisites
- Node 12 / NPM 6

For a ready to use Docker environment with all prerequisites already installed
and prepared, you can check out the [Docker environment](#docker-environment)
section.

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-activity-poi
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd ActivityPOIWebcomponent/
```

### Dependencies

Download all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Development

In order to serve the application locally, execute the following command

```bash
npm run start
```

Then, access to localhost:3000 from your browser.

## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Docker environment

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Dependenices

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm install"
```

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm run test"
```
